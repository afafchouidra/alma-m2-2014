## Sirius Project

The goal of this project will be the creation of a full fledged graphical Designer. In order to realize this designer, you can reuse your work for realized during the tutorial or you can use your own dedicated Ecore meta-model. A good starting point would be to use the family metamodel (not the basic family one) or another one like the metamodel of the Dart Designer.

Your designer must contain the following features :

1 - One viewpoint containing a Diagram representation. This representation should contain a default layer with a node mapping, a container mapping, a bordered node mapping and a list container mapping.

2 - This representation should contain an additional layer showing sub nodes of the list container mapping.

3 - Create an additional representation showing two different kinds of edge mapping

4 - Add a validation rule

5 - Add a filter to hide the bordered node mapping

6 - Creation tool, direct edit tool

7 - Diagram representation -> navigation and representation creation tool (double click)

8 - Add conditional styles

9 - Unsynchronized mapping -> add existing elements

10 - Tree based representation
